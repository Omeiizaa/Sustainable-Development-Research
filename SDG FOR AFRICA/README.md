# SDG 8 and SDG 9 Comparative Analysis in Selected African Countries

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between SDG 8 (Economic Growth) and SDG 9 (Infrastructure Development) across selected African countries: Ghana, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, and South Africa. By analyzing data from 2000 to 2022, this project aims to provide insights into the correlation and trends of these two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) over time. 

## Objectives
**Trend Analysis**: Identify and visualize trends in SDG 8 and SDG 9 scores across countries over time.
**Correlation Analysis**: Calculate correlation coefficients between SDG 8 and SDG 9 to understand how infrastructure development aligns with economic growth in each country.

### Project Structure
**Data**: Contains SDG 8 and SDG 9 scores from 2000 to 2022 for selected African countries.
**Visualization**: Line plots to show SDG score trends and a heatmap for correlation values between SDG goals by country.
**Analysis**: Includes both trend and correlation analysis, with interpretation based on country-specific performance

## Key Findings
**Trend Analysis**: Reveals each country's progress in economic growth and infrastructure.
**Correlation Analysis**:
Positive Correlations: Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa show positive correlations, indicating that investments in infrastructure are often aligned with economic growth.
Negative Correlation: Morocco exhibits a moderate negative correlation, suggesting potential discrepancies between infrastructure growth and economic development.
